# Assignment 1: Introduction

Student name: Spasic Makarije
Student number:
Hours spent on requirements (approx.): 30 minutes (for the 1st task) 
Hours spent on extra credit (approx.):

# First, some questions about where you come from and how you got started.
# Your answers in this section will be used to improve the course.
# They will not be judged or affect your points, but please answer all of them.
# Keep it short; answering shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.

- What are you studying here at Aalto? (Department, major, minor...?)
I'm in Electrical Engineering by mistake, so trying to study Computer Science anyways. Came to Aalto to study Computer Science around Video Games. 

- Which year of your studies is this?
I'm an exchange student, in my 2nd year of Master.

- Is this a mandatory course for you?
No, I chose it

- Have you had something to do with graphics before? Other studies, personal interests, work?
Interested in graphics since I am interested in Video Games, but never really worked on it.

- Do you remember basic linear algebra? Matrix and vector multiplication, cross product, that sort of thing?
Yes, studied it quite some time during my bachelors.

- How is your overall programming experience? What language are you most comfortable with?
I've been "really" programming for 2 years, familiar with Python, Java, C (a little bit less), C++, C#
I would say I don't really have any language I'm more comfortable with

- Do you have some experience with these things? (If not, do you have experience with something similar such as C or Direct3D?)
C++: Yes, had an introductory course last year with an end project
C++11: Yes, during last year's course also
OpenGL: No

- Have you used a version control system such as Git, Mercurial or Subversion? Which ones?
I used Git, directly from Linux command control and on Windows via Gitkraken and a little bit the implemented version of visual studio

- Did you go to the technology lecture?
I saw the courses on Mycourses

- Did you go to exercise sessions?


- Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both?
I used my own computer for the moment

# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

(Try to get everything done! Based on previous data, virtually everyone who put in the work and did well in the first two assignments ended up finishing the course, and also reported a high level of satisfaction at the end of the course.)

                            opened this file (0p): done
                         R1 Moving an object (1p): done
R2 Generating a simple cone mesh and normals (3p): not done
  R3 Converting mesh data for OpenGL viewing (3p): not done
           R4 Loading a large mesh from file (3p): not done

# Did you do any extra credit work?

(Describe what you did and, if there was a substantial amount of work involved, how you did it. Also describe how to use/activate your extra features, if they are interactive.)

# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?

(Please provide a list of the problems. If possible, describe what you think the cause is, how you have attempted to diagnose or fix the problem, and how you would attempt to diagnose or fix it if you had more time or motivation. This is important: we are more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.)

# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?

(Did you help others? Did others help you? Let us know who you talked to, and what sort of help you gave or received.)

# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)
I had a little bit of difficulty entering the assignment in the beginning, because I hadn't watched the last course, but then after some time figuring how everything worked it was manageable.
